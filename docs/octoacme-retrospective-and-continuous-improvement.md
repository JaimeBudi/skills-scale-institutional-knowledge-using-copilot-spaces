# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items

## Action Item Ownership and Tracking

Action items from retrospectives should have clear ownership based on the type of improvement:

- **Process improvements**: Scrum Master or Project Manager
- **Technical improvements**: Technical Lead or assigned Developer
- **Requirements process**: Business Analyst
- **Design process**: UX/UI Designer
- **Product process**: Product Manager
- **Support process**: Support/Customer Success Manager

All action items should be tracked in the project backlog or issues with:
- Clear owner from the appropriate role
- Due date (typically within 1-2 sprints)
- Success criteria to measure completion
- Regular review in weekly PM syncs
