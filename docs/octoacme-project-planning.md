# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Cross-Role Collaboration in Planning

### Kickoff and Backlog Creation
- **Product Manager**: Presents product vision and prioritized features
- **Business Analyst**: Clarifies requirements and acceptance criteria for each backlog item
- **UX/UI Designer**: Shares design approach, timelines for mockups and user testing
- **Technical Lead**: Reviews technical approach, identifies architecture work needed
- **Developers**: Participate in estimation and raise technical questions
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates planning sessions and ensures team capacity alignment
- **Support/Customer Success**: Shares customer insights and priorities based on feedback
